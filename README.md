Principles from Dona M.Wong 1. bar graph x-axis starting from 0 2. bar graph uses same color to represent the same variable, so the readers can focus on comparing the data 3. use deep blue for conservative tone 4. used natural increments of 0, 25, 50, 75, 100 5. annotation on key values of the graph 6. used bar graph instead of column graph. Because the names are tilted in column graph, making it difficult to read. 7. changed legend to the top for easy reading 8. made headline bigger and easier to read

***I was having trouble with this week's lecture about formating and annotation. I used a different data base and a different graph, and everything didn't make much sense to me. Hence I didn't make too drastic change, but I did optimize as much as I can. Everything is due before the spring break so I didn't have much time exploring different configurations. I still have trouble internalizing some of the codes. I will sign up for office hour more often in the future. Sorry, this assignment really did lose me.
